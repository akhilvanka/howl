# Howl

A crate based on Doggo.Ninja's "woof" bash script. This is still a WIP, however the current build is stable and released on Crates.io for download.

## Setup

'''
cargo install howl
'''

## Usage

Its simple, just run:
'''
howl path/to/file
'''
and thats it. If its the first time running, then it will prompt to add your token.

The script will send the file to Doggo.ninja, and copy the url to the upload to the clipboard.
